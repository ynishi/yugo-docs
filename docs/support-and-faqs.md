# Support and FAQs

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: What types of API documentation does Yugo support?
A: Yugo is flexible and can analyze various types of API documentation. While we support OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, our system uses advanced language models to analyze documentation in other formats as well, including Markdown. This allows us to process a wide range of API documentation styles.

### Q2: Can I integrate multiple AI features into my service?
A: Yes, you can integrate multiple AI features. We recommend starting with one or two features and gradually adding more as you become familiar with the platform. Each integration is based on the specific analysis of your API documentation.

### Q3: How secure is my API documentation and data?
A: In the current demo version, we prioritize ease of use for testing purposes. We recommend using only public information for this demo. Rest assured, in the full product version, we will implement stringent security measures, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, to protect your sensitive information.

### Q4: What if the recommended AI features don't meet my needs?
A: Our AI feature recommendations are dynamically generated based on the analysis of your specific API documentation. Unlike a fixed catalog of pre-defined features, we create custom suggestions tailored to your API's structure and apparent functionality. If the initial recommendations don't fully meet your needs, you can initiate a new analysis or contact our support team for more specialized assistance.

### Q5: Can I customize the AI models or features used?
A: While we don't offer direct customization of the underlying AI models in the current version, we do provide flexibility in feature customization. After integration, you can directly edit the prompts used for each AI feature. This allows for a form of prompt engineering, enabling you to fine-tune the AI's behavior to better suit your specific needs. We're continuously working on expanding customization options in future updates.

### Q6: How often are new AI features or capabilities added?
A: As our system generates AI features based on your specific API, new capabilities are essentially created with each analysis. We're constantly improving our underlying models and analysis techniques, which in turn enhances the quality and range of AI features we can suggest and implement for your services.

### Q7: Is there a limit to the size or complexity of API documentation I can analyze?
A: While our system can handle a wide range of documentation sizes and complexities, extremely large or complex APIs might require additional processing time. If you encounter any issues with large documentation sets, please contact our support team for assistance.

### Q8: How does Yugo handle versioning of API integrations?
A: Currently, each integration is treated as a new instance. However, we're working on implementing a versioning system in future updates to allow for easier management and tracking of changes in your AI integrations over time.

Remember, Yugo is continuously evolving. We appreciate your feedback and use it to improve our platform. If you have any questions not covered here, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
