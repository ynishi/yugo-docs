# Yugo (AI-Web Fusion Platform): Alpha v0.1 Demo Guide

Welcome to the alpha version (v0.1) of Yugo, our AI-Web Fusion Platform. This guide outlines the current capabilities and limitations of our demo.

## Current Capabilities
- Basic analysis of API documentation
- AI feature recommendations based on simple heuristics
- Integration guides for OpenAI and Hugging Face

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Security**: 
   - This prototype does not include production-level security features.
   - Do not use real API keys or sensitive data in this demo.

2. **Scalability**: 
   - The current version is not optimized for high-volume requests.
   - Performance may be limited during peak usage times.

3. **Accuracy**: 
   - AI recommendations are based on basic analysis and may not always be optimal.
   - Manual verification of suggestions is recommended.

4. **Integration Depth**: 
   - Integrations are simplified and may not cover all edge cases.
   - Additional development work may be required for production use.

5. **Support**: 
   - This is a prototype, so full technical support is not available.
   - Please use our community forums for questions and feedback.
